        Welcome! This website is where I showcase my work experience and expertise as well as tell you a little bit about who I am. Here you’ll find all the work-related information there is about me from my resume to my thoughts on roles I’ve had and even photos of me and my work.
        My name is Kiesha Smith and I’m 33 years old. I’ve lived in the Boise, Idaho area my entire life and continue to do so to this day where I work at a local government entity with a group of amazing people. I’m currently enrolled at Mizzou to finish my bachelor’s degree in education and leadership, with the hopes of someday becoming an elementary school librarian.
