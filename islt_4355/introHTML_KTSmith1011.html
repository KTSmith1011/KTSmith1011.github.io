    <title>Welcome to Kiesha's Website</title>

My name is Kiesha Smith and I’m 33 years old. I’ve lived in the Boise, Idaho area my entire life and continue to do so to this day. I work at a local government entity with a group of amazing people. My husband and I have two dogs, Zoe and Ruger, who we spend most of our time with. We enjoy off roading in our Jeep Wrangler, fishing, and watching movies. In my spare time, I do a lot of reading as well. The only web development experience I have is from being a teenager and customizing my MySpace page so my only expectations for this course is to pass it.
