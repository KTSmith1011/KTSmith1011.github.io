            Public Works Records Specialist Lead
            •	This is the current role that I am in. I took it to focus on a single, incredibly large project that our team has been trying to do for years and we couldn’t get anyone in the position. I voluntarily stepped down as supervisor so I can make sure the digitization of over 1200 physical records boxes is done properly, with the hopes of someday getting my supervisor position back.
            •	In this role, I focus on sorting the contents of each box by document type, then determine whether or not the contents are already digitized by querying them in our records management system. Once I’ve done this for each box, I will scan the contents that have been determined to not be in the system already.

            Public Works Records and Information Supervisor
            •	In this position, I supervised a team of three in the records management for Public Works at the City of Boise. Together, we handled all incoming public records requests, training for the department, phones, the front desk, and much more.

            Public Information Specialist/LE Records Tech III
            •	This position that I held at the Ada County Sheriff’s Office dealt daily with public information requests and the release of records. On average, I would handle roughly 3000 requests per year ranging from typical automobile accident reports to sensitive and confidential on-body video recordings.
