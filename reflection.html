            The focus of my career thus far has been information and records
            management, both of which I’m absolutely passionate about. I love
            information and ensuring that the proper information is disseminated to
            the right people. I love records and the history they hold which is what
            has inspired me to finish my Bachelor’s degree and go on for Master’s in
            library and information science.
        </div>
        <div>
            Currently, I love my position and what I’m doing as I get my hands on
            historical records every single day. I get to know the history of the
            Public Works Department for the City of Boise and that gives me a great
            deal of knowledge. I’m lucky to be able to say that I love what I do.
        </div>
        <div>
            In the future, my hope is to stay with the City of Boise but move
            departments and work for one of our many libraries. I’d love to work
            with children, which is why I’m getting my Bachelor’s degree in
            education. I also have a passion for teaching, whether it’s children or
            adults.
        </div>
        <div>
            The culmination of my current field and past experience plus multiple
            degrees should result in the ability to obtain a new, dream position of
            working with kids at a local library or school.
